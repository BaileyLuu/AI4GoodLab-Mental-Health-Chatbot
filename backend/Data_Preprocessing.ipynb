And Hollywood culture hasn't helped with romantic comedies and song lyrics telling us that when a man appears evasive, there's something to worry about.\\u00a0It's been my clinical experience though that most women value transparency and security in their relationships. So you might try sharing a little bit more about your history with this woman. For example:Where did you meet her?How long were you friends before you decided to call it quits?\\u00a0Why don't you want to be friends with her (i.e., what do you mean by \\\"kind of crazy\\\")? I promise this tends to matter to women.Were you ever intimately involved with or even attracted to her?If your girlfriend can truly see that you view her as the filet mignon to the other woman's hamburger, and that she is your favorite person on the planet and has NOTHING to worry about, she may start to come around.Now, IF she's more concerned that you might be taking this woman's calls behind your back, while I'm not typically a huge fan of sharing passwords or phone records, you might print them off and highlight this female's number and show your girlfriend that you absolutely are telling the truth.And if you really want to step it up, I would be intentional about doing all the little things that you know your girlfriend loves that helped make her fall in love with you in the first place (e.g., little love notes for her to find or sweet text messages, buy a rose or her favorite flower, have her car detailed, do the laundry...date nights...you get the idea). \\u00a0Bottom line - show your girlfriend why out of all the women on the planet that you could be with, you CHOSE HER. \\u00a0And would continue to do so all over again. \\u00a0AND why you love HER as a person. \\u00a0This will help her trust what you're saying.\\u00a0Best of luck to you! \\u00a0Tamara Powell, LMHC\",\n          \"Hello! Thank you for your question. There are few things\\nthat people find more personal than their sexual relationships. When we feel\\nconnected to our partner, sex can be best thing since sliced bread. However, if\\nwe feel disconnected in some way, sex can feel degrading and even painful. \\nI don\\u2019t know the specifics about your relationship or how\\ncomfortable you are in talking to your boyfriend, but this is one of those\\nsituations where communicating your fears is a good idea. The only exception to\\nthat would be if you believe he is actually a threat to you in some way. If you\\nbelieve that, then you should do whatever you think is safe. It sounds like\\nthere is a part of you that is already afraid of him, and if that is the case\\nthen remaining safe is your top priority. \\nAssuming you are able to share with him your feelings,\\ntelling him what you are and are not interested in sexually is very appropriate\\nand sexually healthy. Sex is something that is supposed to be enjoyable for\\nall parties. All parties should feel respected and able to say \\u201cno\\u201d to\\nabsolutely anything they are not comfortable with. \\nI call the respectful agreement between sexual partners, \\u201csex\\ntrust.\\u201d Sex Trust means your partner respects your boundaries. It means they\\nwon\\u2019t degrade you sexually with hurtful words, forced sex, or forcing or\\ncoercing sex in ways someone is not interested in having. \\u00a0Your personal safety and mental well-being is\\nwhat is most important. \\nNow, if there is a part of you that is curious about BDSM\\nand may be interested in participating in it, there are many websites that you\\ncan explore to learn information. I will warn you, some websites and articles\\nare better or worse than others, but you may at least feel more informed. \\nMany people engage in BDSM and have happy relationships, but\\nagain, it completely depends on what each person in the relationship wants. It is\\nalso important to know that BDSM is not\\u00a0just one thing and people practice it\\ndifferently based on comfort. If it is something you are uncomfortable with,\\nthen you shouldn\\u2019t feel obligated to do it.\\n\\u00a0\\nI hope this was helpful. Be well.\\n\\u00a0\\nRobin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC\",\n          \"It is totally normal - you have a lot riding on this and you're invested! Think about why you feel so shaky - is it something about the therapist or their style? If so, it would be a good idea to talk with them about it so you feel more at ease.

Sometimes more physical activities, such as doing a few jumping jacks, can be helpful. If you don't exercise, it might be something to talk with your doctor about first.The more you can learn about what makes you want to cut, the easier it will be to find out what you could do to change that.

Goodbye for now.\",\n          \"<HUMAN>: How can I find help for an alcohol or drug use problem?\\n<ASSISTANT>: Seeking help for substance use issues is an important step towards a healthier and happier life.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, it's essential to remember that you don't have to go through this alone. There are many resources available to help you navigate through these difficulties. One of the best ways to start is by confiding in someone you trust, such as a close friend or family member. Sharing your struggles with someone you feel comfortable with can provide emotional support and help you feel less isolated.\\n\\nProfessional help is also crucial in dealing with alcohol or drug use problems. Consider reaching out to a mental health professional or a substance abuse counselor. These experts are trained to offer guidance, understanding, and specialized treatment tailored to your specific needs. They can assist you in understanding the root causes of your substance use and develop strategies to cope with triggers and cravings. Support groups can be immensely beneficial in your journey to recovery as well.\\n\\nAdditionally, consider contacting a helpline or crisis hotline. These services are available 24/7 and provide confidential support and information about local resources. The professionals on these helplines can offer immediate assistance and help you take the next steps towards recovery.\",\n          \"<HUMAN>: How Does Hypnotherapy Work?\\n<ASSISTANT>: Hypnotherapy is usually considered an aid to psychotherapy (counselling), rather than a treatment in itself. It helps with psychotherapy because the hypnotic state allows people to enter a deep state of relaxation that can better allow them to explore painful thoughts, feelings, and memories they might have hidden from their conscious minds. In addition, hypnosis enables people to perceive some things differently, such as blocking an awareness of pain.\\n\\nHypnotherapy can be used in two ways, as suggestion therapy or for patient analysis.\\n\\n1. Suggestion therapy: The hypnotic state makes the person better able to respond to suggestions. Therefore, hypnotherapy can help some people stop certain behaviours, such as smoking or nail-biting.\\n\\n2.

And Hollywood culture hasn't helped with romantic comedies and song lyrics telling us that when a man appears evasive, there's something to worry about.\\u00a0It's been my clinical experience though that most women value transparency and security in their relationships. So you might try sharing a little bit more about your history with this woman. For example:Where did you meet her?How long were you friends before you decided to call it quits?\\u00a0Why don't you want to be friends with her (i.e., what do you mean by \\\"kind of crazy\\\")? I promise this tends to matter to women.Were you ever intimately involved with or even attracted to her?If your girlfriend can truly see that you view her as the filet mignon to the other woman's hamburger, and that she is your favorite person on the planet and has NOTHING to worry about, she may start to come around.Now, IF she's more concerned that you might be taking this woman's calls behind your back, while I'm not typically a huge fan of sharing passwords or phone records, you might print them off and highlight this female's number and show your girlfriend that you absolutely are telling the truth.And if you really want to step it up, I would be intentional about doing all the little things that you know your girlfriend loves that helped make her fall in love with you in the first place (e.g., little love notes for her to find or sweet text messages, buy a rose or her favorite flower, have her car detailed, do the laundry...date nights...you get the idea). \\u00a0Bottom line - show your girlfriend why out of all the women on the planet that you could be with, you CHOSE HER. \\u00a0And would continue to do so all over again. \\u00a0AND why you love HER as a person. \\u00a0This will help her trust what you're saying.\\u00a0Best of luck to you! \\u00a0Tamara Powell, LMHC\",\n          \"Hello! Thank you for your question. There are few things\\nthat people find more personal than their sexual relationships. When we feel\\nconnected to our partner, sex can be best thing since sliced bread. However, if\\nwe feel disconnected in some way, sex can feel degrading and even painful. \\nI don\\u2019t know the specifics about your relationship or how\\ncomfortable you are in talking to your boyfriend, but this is one of those\\nsituations where communicating your fears is a good idea. The only exception to\\nthat would be if you believe he is actually a threat to you in some way. If you\\nbelieve that, then you should do whatever you think is safe. It sounds like\\nthere is a part of you that is already afraid of him, and if that is the case\\nthen remaining safe is your top priority. \\nAssuming you are able to share with him your feelings,\\ntelling him what you are and are not interested in sexually is very appropriate\\nand sexually healthy. Sex is something that is supposed to be enjoyable for\\nall parties. All parties should feel respected and able to say \\u201cno\\u201d to\\nabsolutely anything they are not comfortable with. \\nI call the respectful agreement between sexual partners, \\u201csex\\ntrust.\\u201d Sex Trust means your partner respects your boundaries. It means they\\nwon\\u2019t degrade you sexually with hurtful words, forced sex, or forcing or\\ncoercing sex in ways someone is not interested in having. \\u00a0Your personal safety and mental well-being is\\nwhat is most important. \\nNow, if there is a part of you that is curious about BDSM\\nand may be interested in participating in it, there are many websites that you\\ncan explore to learn information. I will warn you, some websites and articles\\nare better or worse than others, but you may at least feel more informed. \\nMany people engage in BDSM and have happy relationships, but\\nagain, it completely depends on what each person in the relationship wants. It is\\nalso important to know that BDSM is not\\u00a0just one thing and people practice it\\ndifferently based on comfort. If it is something you are uncomfortable with,\\nthen you shouldn\\u2019t feel obligated to do it.\\n\\u00a0\\nI hope this was helpful. Be well.\\n\\u00a0\\nRobin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC\",\n          \"It is totally normal - you have a lot riding on this and you're invested!
